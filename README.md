A set of instances on different forms and models of generative artificial intelligence

VoiceDraw is a productive artificial intelligence practice and offers the opportunity to image generation, voice generation and work with multiple forms. 

The recorder.py file was prepared for voice recording, the painter.py file was prepared for the process of converting text inputs into images, and the transcriptor.py file was prepared for converting audio data into text. 

The framework structure that includes all these files is located in the app.py file. 

This study, prepared using the Streamlit web interface structure, is an example of working with multi modality forms.
